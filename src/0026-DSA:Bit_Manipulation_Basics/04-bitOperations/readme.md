## Solution Approach

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding Bitwise Operations**:
   - **OR**: The result is 1 if either of the bits is 1.
   - **XOR**: The result is 1 if the bits are different.
   - **AND**: The result is 1 if both bits are 1.

2. **Performing OR Operation**:
   - Write down the two binary numbers and apply the OR operation bit by bit.

     ```
     1010011
   OR 1001001
     --------
     1011011
     ```

3. **Performing XOR Operation**:
   - Write down the two binary numbers and apply the XOR operation bit by bit.

     ```
     1010011
   XOR 1001001
     --------
     0011010
     ```

4. **Performing AND Operation**:
   - Write down the two binary numbers and apply the AND operation bit by bit.

     ```
     1010011
   AND 1001001
     --------
     1000001
     ```

### Conclusion

The correct bitwise operations on \( a = 1010011 \) and \( b = 1001001 \) are:
- OR = 1011011
- XOR = 0011010
- AND = 1000001
