### Q6. Bit Operations - 5

**Problem Description**

What are the values of \( a \& a \), \( a | a \), \( a \oplus a \)?

**Answer Options**

- [ ] \( a \& a = a \), \( a | a = a \), \( a \oplus a = a \)
- [x] \( a \& a = a \), \( a | a = a \), \( a \oplus a = 0 \)
- [ ] \( a \& a = 0 \), \( a | a = a \), \( a \oplus a = a \)
- [ ] \( a \& a = 0 \), \( a | a = a \), \( a \oplus a = 0 \)

You can submit your answer by selecting the correct option.

## Solution Approach

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding Bitwise AND Operation**:
   - The bitwise AND operation between a number \( a \) and itself will always result in \( a \). This is because each bit in \( a \) ANDed with itself will be the same.
   - Example: \( a = 1010 \)
     - \( a \& a = 1010 \& 1010 = 1010 \)

2. **Understanding Bitwise OR Operation**:
   - The bitwise OR operation between a number \( a \) and itself will always result in \( a \). This is because each bit in \( a \) ORed with itself will be the same.
   - Example: \( a = 1010 \)
     - \( a | a = 1010 | 1010 = 1010 \)

3. **Understanding Bitwise XOR Operation**:
   - The bitwise XOR operation between a number \( a \) and itself will always result in 0. This is because each bit in \( a \) XORed with itself will be 0.
   - Example: \( a = 1010 \)
     - \( a \oplus a = 1010 \oplus 1010 = 0000 \)

### Conclusion

For any number \( a \):
- \( a \& a = a \)
- \( a | a = a \)
- \( a \oplus a = 0 \)

Therefore, the correct answer is \( a \& a = a \), \( a | a = a \), \( a \oplus a = 0 \).
